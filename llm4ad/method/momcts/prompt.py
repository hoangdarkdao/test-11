        ### List heuristics
        Below is a list of design heuristics grouped by dominance relationships (Pareto principle).
        {indivs_prompt}
        ### Guide
        - Keep in mind, heuristics are **grouped by dominance** rather than ranked linearly.
        - The **Nondominated** group represents the best trade-offs among objectives.
        - The **Dominated** group contains heuristics that are outperformed on at least one objective.
        - The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
        '**Analysis:**\n**Experience:**'
        In there:
        + Meticulously analyze **comments, docstrings, and source code** of several pairs or groups of heuristics across and within these groups to fill **Analysis:**.
        Example: “Comparing nondominated vs dominated heuristics, we see ...; Within nondominated ones, comparing ...; Overall: ...”
        + Self-reflect to extract useful experience for designing better heuristics and fill **Experience:** (< 60 words).
        I’m going to tip $999K for a better nondominated heuristic design! Let’s think step by step.'''

        Your task is to redefine ‘Current self-reflection’ paying attention to avoid all things in ‘Ineffective self-reflection’ in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.
